            <h2>Enjoy your trip </h2>
            <p>When booking a bus ticket, it is usually months in advance. People do it to get a good deal on tickets as they become up to 10 times more expensive when the travel date is getting closer. If you  have that kind of luxury to plan a vacation that far ahead, then opting for a bus ticket is definitely a thing to do. Also, in case you want to change your departure date, with bus tickets is no problem at all. Just contact customer support via e-mail with your ticket number stating that you need to change departure date and that’s it. Easy peasy!</p>
            <p>In general. Firstly, there’s more space for legs. It can get really frustrating when you constantly bump your knees in the seat in front of you and the fact that you can adjust your seat is a nightmare if the bus is more than few hours long. In any buses have that kind of problem since you can adjust your seat as much as you want, just make sure that the person behind you is okay with that</p>

            <p>My wife and I travelled from chennai to ooty Krumlov on the Student Agency bus. Online booking was easy and allowed choice of date, time and seat which was great.
                Loading of the passengers and luggage was orderly due to the conductor host who also travels on the bus.</p>

            <p>The bus was new and had facilities equal to airline travel. The free entertainment system had limited choice but most could find something suitable. There was reasonable wifi on board,
            Free coffee or cappuccino was served and was quite good.</p>
